Components for web applications and sample blog application. 

##Idea of the project
Main idea is to create a set of components that can be used for making web applications.
This project comes with blog application. 

##Some new features
- Top clean - developers need to write little code on top to get things working.
- Redirects - We can redirect to object we want to use. For example, by adding redirect($object='SomeObject'){return $object;} to a class we can make it produce another object.
